Open source software is a massive technology in todays world. Yet many of us are unaware of the influence of open source. "Without Opensource" completely focussed on open source, it's reach and services offered. The session started at 7:00PM IST(9:30 EST). There were many misconceptions and doubts in the field of open source, this session became a complete answer to all those.

 Mr. Allen started by building basic knowledge on opensource. Many of us were totally unaware of the scope of opensource in the present world. The speaker pointed out the presence of open source softwares in our day to day life and the situations in which we come accross them. There was a time when the proprietary softwares ruled the world, but today as we know the situations have changed. People are aware of the advantages of open source softwares. Open source includes source codes which is made freely available for modification and redistribution. He also included the advantages of opensource over other softwares. Open source softwares are cheaper and user-friendly.
